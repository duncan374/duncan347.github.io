        <h1>Expectations Met Project 1</h1>
        <p>We have met all 20 of the expectations. The website contains 10 pages all with headings, a consistent style, navigation bar, and media queries so that the pages are responsive to screen size.</p>
        <p>All images contain alt attributes in the event that they do not properly show up. Each webpage also has a favicon declaired and all CSS/Images are placed in their respective directories and our webpage was not built using any frameworks.</p>
        <p>Lastly, all files were validated using the W3 validators, all of our files contain entirely lowercase and alphanumeric characters, implemented flexboxes/grids to certain webpages, and links to external sites.</p>

        <h1>Expectations Met Project 2</h1>
        <p>First and foremost we addressed the main issues of project 1, which was primarily cards not being the same height and looking uniform, and the mobile format looking weird.</p>
        <p>We implemented a database to store submissions from the contact page and an admin login to allow admins to login and give them the ability to view and delete submissions.</p>
        <p>We have input on the contact.html, contact.php login.php, and adminpage.php pages</p>
        <p>We added a little animation to the equipment page wher hovering over a piece of equipment will slightly enlarge it and make it sway a little to put emphasis on it.</p>

        <h1>Client Critique Project 1</h1>
        <p>The client would like a touch up on the formatting of elements, specifically image size and optimization. The social media page also needs to include buttons/icons for the different social media platform links with the navbar to be fixed on the page when the viewer scrolls down.</p>

        <h1>Client Critique Project 2</h1>
        <p></p>

        <h1>Contribution</h1>
        <p>Blake created the general style and made the affiliations page, the equipment page, and the how to join page. In project 2 Blake implemented the database and the admin login page.</p>
        <p>Duncan was the main connection to the client and also provided most of the information to fill the project with. Duncan created the intro page, the practices page, the tornuments page, and the executive board page. Duncan also touched up the project in general a little bit after. In Project 2, Duncan helped with the styling a little and created the sticky navbar.</p>
        <p>Erik created the photo gallery, the contact page and the affiliations page. In project 2, Erik wrote the report for the project and added animations.</p>
