        <h1>Expectations Met</h1>
        <p>We have met all 20 of the expectations. The website contains 10 pages all with headings, a consistent style, navigation bar, and media queries so that the pages are responsive to screen size.</p>
        <p>All images contain alt attributes in the event that they do not properly show up. Each webpage also has a favicon declaired and all CSS/Images are placed in their respective directories and our webpage was not built using any frameworks.</p>
        <p>Lastly, all files were validated using the W3 validators, all of our files contain entirely lowercase and alphanumeric characters, implemented flexboxes/grids to certain webpages, and links to external sites.</p>

        <h1>Client Critique</h1>
        <p>The client would like a touch up on the formatting of elements, specifically image size and optimization. The social media page also needs to include buttons/icons for the different social media platform links with the navbar to be fixed on the page when the viewer scrolls down.</p>
